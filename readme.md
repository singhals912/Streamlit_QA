# ```mgmt590-am-rest-api``` Question Answering API
This API allows you to answer your questions pulling out the information from the contextual information provided as input to the API. This API uses the question and context passed in the body of the request and takes the model as a parameter. The API uses the hugging face transformers model to answer the question and the model used to answer would be dependent on the user.

## Getting Started
The API has been deployed on cloud and it can be invoked using the URL provided and passing the required available routes or methods defined in second section. Another way to run the API and test the functionality would be to get a local image of the code and run it on your local machine which would require the installation of the dependent libraries described in the next section for successful execution of the API.

_**API URL - (Publically Available on Cloud)**_
 ```
      Base URL: https://mgmt590-am-rest-api-wbv4eowlaa-uc.a.run.app
 ```

### Prerequisites and Installation
To run this application, you'll need the following pre-requisites installed on your machine

| Library      | Version | Installation |

Paul is suffering from a severe bladder infection and receives John Coffey, a physically imposing but mentally challenged black man, into his custody. John had been sentenced to death after being convicted of raping and murdering two white girls. One of the other inmates is a Native-American named Arlen Bitterbuck, who is charged with murder and is the first to be executed. Percy demonstrates a severe sadistic streak, but, as the nephew of Louisiana's First Lady, he is beyond reproach. He is particularly abusive with inmate Eduard Delacroix; he breaks Del's fingers with his baton, steps on a pet mouse named Mr. Jingles, which Del had adopted, repeatedly calls him by a gay slur, and ultimately sabotages his execution by failing to soak the sponge used to conduct electricity to Del's head; Del dies screaming in pain."

## Build
There are two ways to deploy the API on your local machine:
<li> <b> Deployment with Flask: </b></li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To deploy the app on your local machine through flask, we just need to run the python file

``` 
>>> python question_answer.py 
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. This will deploy your app on your local machine. Post successful deployment of the code
```
 * Serving Flask app 'question_answer' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on all addresses.
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. You can access the API through sending requests through Postman. (Download Postman from here - [Link](https://www.postman.com/downloads/))
*Sample Call*
```
GET http://0.0.0.0:8080/models
```
*Sample Screen*

<li> <b> Container Deployment through Docker: </b> </li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To deploy the app on your local machine through docker, we need a docker file ,given we already have the application file created, that would be the recipe for docker to build the application
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. In the dockerfile, we will add the required dependency of tensorflow and pytorch to run the transformers model.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Once the dockerfile is created, we add the dependencies to be installed in the docker image in the requirements.txt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. After you add the dependencies in requirements.txt; you'll run it when the docker container would be published and deployed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We'll copy the application in the app folder and run the application once the docker image was deployed

*Sample Requirements.txt*
```
flask == 2.0.1
transformers == 4.6.1
```
*Sample Dockerfile*
````
FROM tensorflow/tensorflow

ADD requirements.txt .

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY <aap-name>.py /app/<aap-name>.py

CMD ['python','/app/<aap-name>.py']

````
*Building the Docker Image in the Active Directory/Folder*
```
sudo docker build -t <image-name> . 
```

*Running the Docker Image - with ports defined for communication between local machine and docker image* 
```
sudo docker run -it -p 8080:8080 <image-name> /app/<aap-name>.py
```
